# Data-Assignment-2

Pitch:
I want to look at data involving spotify users from around the world, specifically paid subscription users vs who uses the platform for free. When compiling the data, I found that there are a lot of interesting things in the data. In Europe and North America, there are more paid subscribers than unpaid, vs Latin America and the rest of the world where paid users are 30-40% of users. Another intersting thing I see in the data set is that in Latin America and Rest of the World the percent of paid users goes down every year since 2018, and in Europe and North America the percentage goes up. I want to look at the differences between a paid and unpaid subscription to Spotify, and see how the economy of certain regions and the pandemic affect this data.
